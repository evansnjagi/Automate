Assigment:

You are a teacher and want to automate assigning grades on a student's score.

**Requirements** 

Ask the students to enter their scores. The scores should range between 0 and 100.

Grade assignment chart

| score| Grade|
|------|:----:|
| 90 - 100 | A |
| 80 - 89 | B |
| 70 - 79 | C |
| 60 - 69 | D |
| 50 - 59 | F |

If the input is outside (0, 100) print a warning message.

Also ask for multiple scores until the user types done.

Keep track of how many the student got and print a summary at the end.
